description: Teaching is my passion and my main reason for returning to graduate school. I hope to continue my post-graduate career in a teaching position at the university level. As a graduate student, I have had the fortune to instruct multiple courses, including our undergraduate quantum computing course. I have worked on this course both at CU Boulder and UC Santa Cruz. An overarching career goal is to bring this course to new universities. Beyond instructing, I TA almost every semeter and am usually involved in creating problem sets and exams in addition to normal TA duties. <br> <br> In Spring of 2023, I was awarded the Best TA Award of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
