description: I love teaching. It is one of the main reasons I am in graduate school and one of my best skill sets. As a graduate student, I have started instructing courses, the most important being our undergraduate quantum computing course. I hope to continue developing and instructing this course as I progress beyond my PhD. Beyond instructing, I am one of the managers for CU Boulder's CS-wide TA staff. My duties focus on helping students with their pedagogy and teaching skills but I am also in charge of many behind the scenes details to support our large CS TA staff. I take pedagogy seriously and am always trying to improve my own teaching skills and those around me.
