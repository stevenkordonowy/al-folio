I am a PhD student in the [CS Theory](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory) group at the University of Colorado Boulder. My broad focus is computational complexity of algorithms with a focus on quantum computing. [Alex Kolla](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~alko5368/) is my advisor and she would love to (dis/)prove the [Unique Games Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture), please reach out if you have any leads! As an undergraduate, I studied mathematics at the [University of Denver](https://www.math.du.edu/) while also pursuing minors in computer science, physics, and psychology. Between school, I worked as a software engineer at [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-financial-framework-nff) developing data-driven real-time risk management systems.

<!-- Maybe have a work section?
Between school, I spent half a decade working as a software engineer and architect. Most of the time I worked at Nasdaq, Inc. where I worked on real-time risk management applications. I am most comfortable working in Python or Java but would love to work
more seriously in a purely functional language.
