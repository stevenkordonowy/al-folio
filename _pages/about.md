I am a computer science student pursuing my PhD at the University of California - Santa Cruz. My broad focus is quantum computing with particular interest in optimization algorithms for combinatorial problems. Teaching is my main passion and I hope to pursue a position teaching at the university level after completion of my degree. I am supported by [Alex Kolla](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~alko5368/) who would love to (dis/)prove the [Unique Games Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture), please reach out if you have any leads! 

I spent the few years of my graduate career earning my masters in the [CS Theory](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory) group at the University of Colorado Boulder. As an undergraduate, I studied mathematics at the [University of Denver](https://www.math.du.edu/) while also pursuing minors in computer science, physics, and psychology. Between school I spent a few years as a software engineer at [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-financial-framework-nff) developing data-driven real-time risk management systems.

In Spring of 2023, I was awarded the Best TA Award of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
