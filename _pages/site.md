This site is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is a free(!) and awesome service that will build and deploy a simple website straight from your github repository! The service processes your project's `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS` files and freely serves them to `https://<your_project>.github.io`. (It is easy to use a different URL that you own if desired.) To generate the source files, I forked the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme and customized it to my liking which essentially amounted to adding my name and the color scheme. Yellow is my favorite color so any constructive criticism against the coloring will be filed into the *ignored* category. The files are constructed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby-based static website (and blog) generator. It is quite easy to search the web for a Jekyll theme that you like then [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and edit it to make it your own personal or professional website. Did I mention all of this was [free](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)?
