This site is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is a free and awesome service that will build a (simple) website straight from your github repository! The service loads/processes your `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS` files and freely deploys them to `https://<your_site>.github.io`. (You can also easily use a different URL that you own if desired.) To generate the source files, I forked the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme and customized it to my liking which essentially amounted to adding my name and the color scheme. Yellow is my favorite color so any constructive criticism against the coloring will be filed into the *ignored* category. The files are build using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby-based static website and blog generator. It is quite easy to search the web for a Jekyll theme that you like, fork it, and edit it to make it your personal or professional website. Did I mention all of this was [free](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)?
