description: My research focuses on quantum optimization algorithms but I am generally interested in full-stack quantum computation. This involves understanding the fundamental quantum computing principles to quantum gate models to higher level algorithms. The interdisciplinary nature of the subject is what drew me in and I have taken quantum courses in computer science, physics, engineering, and chemistry to build a well-rounded understanding of the subject.
