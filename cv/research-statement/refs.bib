 @article{FGG, title={A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028}, abstractNote={We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.}, note={arXiv:1411.4028 [quant-ph]}, number={arXiv:1411.4028}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Farhi, Edward and Goldstone, Jeffrey and Gutmann, Sam}, year={2014}, month={Nov}, language={en} }

abstract = {We investigate the complexity of finding locally optimal solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Local optimality arises in the context of local search algorithms, which try to find improved solutions by considering perturbations of the current solution (“neighbors” of that solution). If no neighboring solution is better than the current solution, it is locally optimal. Finding locally optimal solutions is presumably easier than finding optimal solutions. Nevertheless, many popular local search algorithms are based on neighborhood structures for which locally optimal solutions are not known to be computable in polynomial time, either by using the local search algorithms themselves or by taking some indirect route. We define a natural class PLS consisting essentially of those local search problems for which local optimality can be verified in polynomial time, and show that there are complete problems for this class. In particular, finding a partition of a graph that is locally optimal with respect to the well-known Kernighan-Lin algorithm for graph partitioning is PLS-complete, and hence can be accomplished in polynomial time only if local optima can be found in polynomial time for all local search problems in PLS.}

The SDP is used to choose the parameters of a variational quantum circuit. The entangled state is then represented as the quantum circuit applied to a product state. It achieves an approximation ratio of 0.582, signiﬁcantly improving on the algorithms of Anshu, Gosset, Morenz, 0.531 [1], and Parekh, Thompson, 0.533 [2]. In addition, we also study the EPR Hamiltonian, which we argue is a natural intermediate problem which isolates some key quantum features of local Hamiltonian problems.

A classical 0.498-approximation, using a basic semidefinite programming relaxation, is known for QMC, paralleling the celebrated 0.878-approximation for classical Max Cut. For Max Cut, improving the 0.878-approximation is Unique-Games-hard (UG-hard), and one might expect that improving the 0.498-approximation is UG-hard for QMC. In contrast, we give a classical 1/2-approximation for QMC that is unconditionally optimal, since simple examples exhibit a gap of 1/2 between the energies of an optimal product state and general quantum state. Our result relies on a new nonlinear monogamy of entanglement inequality on a triangle that is derived from the second level of the quantum Lasserre hierarchy. This inequality also applies to the quantum Heisenberg model, and our results generalize to instances of Max 2-Local Hamiltonian where each term is positive and has no 1-local parts. Finally, we give further evidence that product states are essential for approximations of 2-Local Hamiltonian.}, note={arXiv:2206.08342 [quant-ph]}, number={arXiv:2206.08342}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Parekh, Ojas and Thompson, Kevin}, year={2022}, month={Jun} }
